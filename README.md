Stock Movement Analysis Based on Social Media Sentiment
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict stock movements by extracting and analyzing social media data from platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, or Telegram. By performing sentiment analysis on social media discussions related to specific stocks, this project provides insights into potential price trends and signals for buy/sell decisions.
Objective
The objective of this project is to understand the relationship between social media sentiment and stock price movements. By scraping relevant data, performing sentiment analysis, and correlating these insights with stock prices, we aim to uncover actionable insights for traders and investors.
Data Collection
•	Platform: Reddit (e.g., r/wallstreetbets) or Twitter (stock-specific hashtags)
•	Data Source: Posts discussing stock market trends, predictions, or individual stock performance.
•	Data Scraping Method: Used Python libraries such as praw for Reddit and tweepy for Twitter to collect posts/tweets and their metadata.
•	File: The collected data is stored in data/reddit_stock_posts.csv.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
•	Handled missing values and removed noise from the dataset.
•	Transformed text data into a structured format suitable for sentiment analysis.
•	Performed feature extraction, including sentiment polarity and frequency of stock mentions.
Data Analysis & Feature Extraction
•	Sentiment Analysis: Utilized VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to perform sentiment analysis and determine whether discussions are positive, negative, or neutral.
•	Key Features: Extracted features like sentiment polarity, frequency of mentions for specific stocks, and overall sentiment trends.
•	Topic Modeling (optional): Identified key themes and topics in discussions using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).
Visualization & Reporting
•	Created visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to display:
•	Trends in sentiment polarity over time.
•	Frequency of stock mentions.
•	Correlation between sentiment and stock price movements.
Example Visualizations
1.	Sentiment Trend Over Time: Displays how the sentiment for a particular stock has changed over time.
2.	Mentions vs. Stock Price: Shows if there is any visible correlation between the frequency of mentions and the stock's price movement.
3.	Sentiment Correlation: Illustrates how positive or negative sentiment correlates with price changes.
Results & Findings
Key Insights
1.	Stock X shows a strong correlation between negative sentiment and price drops. This could be a signal for traders to take caution when the overall sentiment turns negative.
2.	Stock Y experiences a rise in price when there is a high volume of positive mentions, indicating potential buy signals.
Possible Buy/Sell Signals
Based on the analysis, buy/sell signals were derived as follows:
•	Buy Signal: When there is a spike in positive sentiment and a high frequency of mentions, it could indicate increased interest and a potential price surge.
•	Sell Signal: When there is a sudden increase in negative sentiment, it could be a signal to sell before further price drops.
Recommendations
•	Diversifying Data Sources: Future analysis could benefit from integrating additional sources like financial news articles or quarterly financial reports.
•	Advanced Sentiment Analysis: Utilizing deep learning models such as BERT or RoBERTa for more nuanced sentiment classification.
